Python Age of Empires 2 - DE one vs one head to head statistics


Hi all,

My name is Filipe Silva, and I'm making this 1vs1 head to head statistics for Age of Empires 2 - Definitive Edition.

The main goal here is to learn Python, so feel free to help me with that.


The system uses the AOE2.net API to get data about players, compare the matches and show the results on the screen.

Using python and Flask.

Thanks,
Filipe SIlva.
